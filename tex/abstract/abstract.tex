\abstract
In the last decade, we have witnessed the cessation of the increase in clock frequency of individual processor cores. At the same time, the number of transistors continues to grow. The current trend is to increase the number of cores, but some problems cannot be parallelized, so this approach does not help.

In this work, we present a method for designing asynchronous digital circuits. These circuits do not require a clock signal and are speed-limited only by gate and connection constraints. We also present a method for implementing such circuits in FPGA.
